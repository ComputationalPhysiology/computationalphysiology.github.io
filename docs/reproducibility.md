# Making reproducible research

Whenever you write code in your research, whether it a full blown software library or just code for running experiments you should always think about reproducibility. Please check out [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) which contains a comprehensive guide.

If you want to create a new package similar to the ones listed in [projects](projects.md), please check out the [reproducibility repo](https://github.com/jorgensd/reproducibility).

If you want to create a reproducible data science project, please check out the [reproducibly project template from the Alan Turing institute](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/reproducible-project-template)
