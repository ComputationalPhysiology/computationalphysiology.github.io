# Computational Physiology at Simula Research Laboratory

In recent years, modeling and simulation of biophysical phenomena has matured in both scope and methodology, such that it can contribute significantly to the present understanding of physiology and disease. The Computational Physiology (ComPhy) department at Simula is an integrated team of researchers working to develop cutting edge biological simulation tools. The group collaborates closely with both experimentalists and clinicians around the world to drive basic research and promote innovation.

A particular strength of the ComPhy group is a diverse set of backgrounds and skill-sets, enabling research into numerical and computational methods to develop state-of-the-art simulation tools, as well as the targeted application of these tools to gain mechanistic insight into diverse biophysical phenomena. The core focus of the group is research into biophysical models of the heart, and modeling efforts span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from investigation of detailed subcellular phenomena to organ-level analysis driven by clinical data.

Current projects include the development of robust and accurate simulators for the electrical and mechanical behavior of heart tissue, flow models of the cardiovascular system and fluid structure interactions, as well as investigation of the role of cellular and tissue structure and function in excitable tissue.

## Software

The Computational Physiology (ComPhy) department at Simula Research Laboratory is an integrated team of researchers working to develop cutting edge biological simulation tools. We have strong believe that in open science and try to share as much as we can of the tools that we develop. You can see some of the code that we have developed in the following repositories:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology)

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/simula-camo/)

Some other sites that are of relevance:

- [https://github.com/kvslab](https://github.com/kvslab)

We also have our own channel at [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/ComPhy)

## Where are we located

We are located just outside Oslo, the capital of Norway at a place called Fornebu, but we plan to move to downtown Oslo in the near future.
