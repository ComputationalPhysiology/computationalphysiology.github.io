# Projects

Here we can write about different projects. Perhaps link to documentation

## Pulse

[Pulse](https://finsberg.github.io/pulse/) is a python package based
on [FEniCS](https://finsberg.github.io/pulse/) that can be used to
solve continuum mechanincs problems using the finite element method.

## CBCBeat

[CBCBeat](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/cbcbeat) is a collection of Python-based solvers for cardiac electrophysiology models.


## simcardems
[`simcardems`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/simcardems) is a FEniCS-based cardiac electro-mechanics solver and is developed as a part of the SimCardio Test project. The solver depends on pulse and cbcbeat.


## LDRB
[`ldrb`](https://github.com/finsberg/ldrb) is a software for assigning myocardial fiber orientations based on the Laplace Dirichlet Ruled-Based algorithm.

## Action potential features
[`ap_features`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/ap_features) is package for computing features of action potential traces

## Gotran
[`gotran`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/gotran) (General ODE TRAnslator) is a library for declaring ODEs and that provide automatic code generation

## Goss
[`goss`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/goss) (General ODE System solver) is a C++ library (with python bindings) for solving ordinary differential equations.

## cardiac-mps
[`cardiac-mps`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/mps) is a package for reading and analyzing MPS data.

## mps-motion
[`mps-motion`](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/mps_motion) is a library for tracking motion in cardiac mps data.
